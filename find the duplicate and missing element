We have given problem 1 to n one number is missing and other number is duplicate find missing and duplicate element 
Input: arr[] = {1,2,4,3,2}
Output: 5 2
Explanation: The missing number is 5 duplicate element is 2

Approach---
we can apply hashmap where we can store the element and their frequency 
in hashmap element can be any order so ,we can use TreeMap that is in sorted 
1--1
2--2
3--1
4--1

first we can check one by one element
first check element is present or not then check the frequency of elemement if it is more than one then it will duplicate element

//second approach is mathmatical
lets idle array look like ={a,b,c,d,e}  f1
but according to question one is missing and one is duplicate{a,b,c,c,d} here c is dup and e is missing f2
now we have to find two variable c and e that require two equation to solve 
first equation we can get by f1-f2 that give e-c
second equation we can get by f1^2-f2^2 that give e^2-c^2 now we f2/f1 that give e+c 
now you have two equation and two variable you can solve .

Limitation --we can not scale this solution if no of duplicate and missing element is increasing it will increase the time complexity .


// main solution 

I will write it latter
